PyBank's python code will go through the budget_data.csv and produce a financial analysis in text file. The financial analysis will have some basic information like how many months are in the record and the total profit over these months. 

PyPoll's python code will review election_data.csv and have a report on the election results. It will calculate the total votes and how many votes each candidate has. At the end, it will conclude who the final winner is for the election.
